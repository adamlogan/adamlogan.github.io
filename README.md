This repo is a barebones html document pointing to shared google documents with information and updates about bills that impact the deaf, hard of hearing, and deafblind and deaf with additional disabilities in the 2025 regular session in the state of Oregon, United States.

The site tracks a few general disabilities bills and environment bills as well, although these are not the primary focus.

The linked Google documents have machine generated transcripts inline, and links to view video recordings with precise timestamps for start and end of the relevant sections of the legislative sessions to help save time for viewers.
