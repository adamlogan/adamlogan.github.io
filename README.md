# Bills Tracked in 2025 Oregon Regular Legislature Session
This repo is a barebones html document pointing to shared google documents with information and updates about bills that impact the deaf, hard of hearing, and deafblind and deaf with additional disabilities in the 2025 regular session in the state of Oregon, United States.

There are also a few general disabilities bills and environment bills tracked as well, although these are not the primary focus.

The google documents have machine generated transcripts, and links to view video recordings with prcise timestamps for start and end of the relevant sections of the bills. Otherwise, hours could be wasted wading through the entire session for the relevant part.
